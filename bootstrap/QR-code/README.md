### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

Bootstrap makes development a lot faster and more efficient with it's components, utility classes, built in typography and grid layouts.  

### Continued development

I would love to add javaScript in the future to bring the webApp to live.

## Reflection Questions

-What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?

there was not any major challenge, it was time consumer looking up bootstrap documents to figure out what i needed for my project

-How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process? 

I did not have to style seperately in css since the utility classes and components has styling built in, althouth i had to take the time to read throuth the documents to see what each component and utility classes does, it was easy to use when you get a hang of it. 


-In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead? 

for this project, i only used custom css to for specific background color using hex colors, and for a specific font that i wanted to use, other than that i rather use bootstrap since it is more efficient and less time consuming.
